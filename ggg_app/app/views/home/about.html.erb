<p class"about_text">How many times have you put a nice accumulator bet on a Saturday and within 10 minutes, one of your teams are 2 or 3 goals down? You can pretty much be sure todays not your lucky day. How about betting on both teams to score? The odds are still nice when in an accumilator and the bets not over, till the games over.</p>

<h1 class="about_title">How it works</h1>

<p class="about_text">The aim of this site is to try and give you a bit more infomation to base your choices on. Instead of being a pure lottery, you can use the stats on this site to make a more informed decision based on a teams last 5 games, the last few times they met and their form throughout the season.</p>
